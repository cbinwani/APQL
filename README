Apromore Build Instructions with Eclipse Virgo

REQUIREMENTS
============

Apromore has been successfully installed on the following platforms:
- Windows 7
- Linux (specifically ubuntu)
- Mac OSX 10.8

Ensure the following software is installed:
- Java 1.7
- Maven 3.1.1
- Ant 1.9.2
- MySQL 5.6.x
- Subversion 1.6

MySQL is the default db that we support but we do have plugins for Postgres and Oracle but some extra setup will be required. The manager
application will need to be told about the change as well as the Assembely project. Also we only have sql scripts to create the database
for H2 and MySQL.

Check out the Apromore source tree from the Subversion repository at http://code.google.com/p/apromore/source/checkout


CONFIGURATION
=============

Configuration occurs in the top level site.properties file.  Because these configurations are site-specific, this file is not present in
the subversion repository.  A template file site.properties_template is provided which can be copied and edited.  The template contains
reasonable defaults, but at least two properties cannot be defaulted and require explicit settings:

- editor.dir: This needs to reference an empty directory with write permission, e.g. C:/Development/Temp/signarvio-root

- fileshare.dir: This is the local directory which will be accessible via WebDAV at http://localhost:9000/filestore/dav
                 e.g. C:/Development/Temp/webdav-root

At this point MySQL isn't required for the builds at it now uses H2. To run Apromore after the build you will need MySQL setup.
Ensure MySQL is configured to accept local TCP connections on port 3306 in its .cnf file; "skip-networking" should not be present.



DATABASE SETUP
==============

Start MySQL
$ sudo mysqld_safe

Set the root password of MySQL to the default used by Apromore
$ mysqladmin -u root password MAcri

Create a database named 'apromore' in your MySQL server
$ mysqladmin --user=root --password=MAcri create apromore

Create a user named 'apromore' with the required permissions
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri
	CREATE USER 'apromore'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MAcri';
	GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK TABLES ON apromore.* TO 'apromore'@'localhost';

Create and populate the database tables.
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri < Supplements/database/db-mysql.sql

At the end of the db-mysql.sql script is where we populate some of the system data including user information. Currently, we have a few users setup that are developers or affiliates and they can be used or you can choose to add your own.  All passwords are encrypted but they are 'password' for the time being and we don't have a facility just yet to allow a user to change there password. This is coming soon as well as a setup utility to allow the creation of a user on first running.


BUILD IT
========

* Change to the root of the project you checked out of SVN.
* Run the ant command 'ant apromore-pre-build'. This will upload any libraries that are needed and not in any maven
  repository, build some support libraries, place all of them in your local maven repository, and generate some lower-level
  configuration files within the source tree using the values in site.properties.
* Run the maven command 'mvn clean install'. This will build the Apromore manager, portal and editor and all the extra plugins.
* Run the ant command 'ant start-virgo'. This will install, configure and start Eclipse Virgo, and deploy Apromore.


TRY IT OUT
==========

Apromore runs on all modern browsers, browse http://localhost:9000/portal
