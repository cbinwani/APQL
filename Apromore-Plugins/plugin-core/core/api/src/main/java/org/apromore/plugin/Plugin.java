 * <p>
 * Interface implemented by every Apromore {@link Plugin}. Each {@link Plugin} offers theses methods, so it is possible to handle all Plugins in a generic manner.
 * Please note implementations should make sure they override {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} in a way, that two Plugins are the same if
 * their name and version match.
 *
 * <p>
 * Plugins are usually only instantiated once in the whole system. (Singleton) So please be careful about the global state of the Plugin!
